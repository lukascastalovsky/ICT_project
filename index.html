            <h2>Vincent van Gogh</h2>
            <p>* 30.3.1853 - † 29.7.1890</p>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch artist born in the city of Zundert, is renowned for his emotionally charged paintings characterized by bold colors and dynamic scenery. His works, such as "Starry Night" resonate with viewers, offering a glimpse into his tumultuous inner world. Despite struggling with mental illness and social isolation, Van Gogh found solace in nature, which he immortalized on canvas. Though his art gained recognition only after his death at 37, his legacy as a pioneer of Post-Impressionism endures, inspiring artists and art lovers worldwide.</p>
